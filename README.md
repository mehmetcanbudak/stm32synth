# stm32synth
Analog synth emulator for stm32 f4

Right now implements: 
- 5 waveforms (sinus, triangle, sawtooth, square and noise).
- Polyphonic playback (somewhat limited due to processor speed and unoptimized code).
- Envelope with Attack and Sustain
- Delay
- 4 Preset filters (FIR lowpass and highpass)
